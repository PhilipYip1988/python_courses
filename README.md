Notes on some Python Courses I took to learn Python.

# Python

[EDX MIT Introduction to Computer Science and Programming](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7)

This course teaches the fundamentals of the Python Programming language and how to approach problems as a programmer. The course sticks to inbuilt Python using the Spyder IDE. The course is taught by MIT and runs three times per year, inline with their academic semesters. You can access the course for free during the duration of a semester or you can pay to access some additional exams and a certificate.

[Udemy Angela Yu 100 Days of Code](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)

The beginning of this course is excellent and is instructor led until day 37 and Angela explains the concepts of the Python Programming Language very well and there are series of challenges after each video which allow you to cement these concepts by coding. After day 37, the format of the course changes completely as it goes into web development and data science. Tutorial videos become scare past day 37. Angela does have another web development course which would be better to take instead of doing day 37-70. Day 70-80 would be better tackled doing a dedicated data science course.

# Data Science

[Jose Portilla Udemy 2022 Python for Machine Learning & Data Science Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-machine-learning-data-science-masterclass/)

[Jose Portill Udemy 2018 Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/)

Make sure to take the 2022 version of this course as quite a number of developments have been made, particularly in the scipy library from 2018 and you will encounter some issues following the 2018 version of the course as it uses depreciated commands.

[Jose Portill Udemy 2018 Interactive Python Dashboards with Plotly and Dash](https://www.udemy.com/course/interactive-python-dashboards-with-plotly-and-dash/)

This course is from 2018 and does not include any contnet on plotly express which was released subsequently. The course gives a really good overview of the use of plotly graphs objects and dash. I made updated [notebooks](https://github.com/PhilipYip1988/plotly_udemy) while taking this course in 2022.
